## Getting Started üåü

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/SauceX22/bike-shop.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install`.
3. **Set up environment variables**: Before starting the development server, you need to configure the environment variables defined in `env.mjs`. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and define the following variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: The URL to your database. Ensure it's a valid URL and not the placeholder `YOUR_MYSQL_URL_HERE`.
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to `development`, `test`, or `production` depending on your environment.
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secret key for NextAuth.js, required in production. Refer to [Next-Auth Docs](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret) for aquirement.
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The base URL of your site for NextAuth.js callbacks. If deploying on Vercel, this can be left as is to automatically use `VERCEL_URL`.
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: The public-facing URL of your application.

   For more details on each environment variable and instructions on how to set them up, please refer to the [Environment Variables Setup Guide](https://github.com/SauceX22/bike-shop/wiki/Environment-Variables-Setup) on our GitHub wiki.

4. **Start the development server**: Execute `npm run dev` and visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
